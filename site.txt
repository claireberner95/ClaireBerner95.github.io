(ABOUT)

Claire Berner is a New York-based graphic designer and illustrator who specializes in posters and branding. She has been painting and collaging all her life, but she discovered a knack for digital work in early 2018, and has been working as a freelance designer and completing a Graphic Design certificate at Parsons since then. She is most inspired by Southwestern lanscapes and early postmodern typefaces, but she is always experimenting with new styles.
